# School-Application

An application built to allow easy management and maintenance of student information within schools to improve the accessibility of student information for teachers as this is something I feel is lacking.

This project was a revision of an older project I created. I aimed to create cleaner code in all my files utilizing new methods that I had learned whilst studying.

## Goals for the project

1. The project came from wanting to put my time studying Javascript into practice with no tutorial to follow.

2. One problem with my original creation was that the code was not as DRY as it could be. My dark mode toggle function was far too long and featured multiple lines to change the appearence of inputs, something I now know can be done in a single forEach loop.

## Technologies Used

1. Javascript
2. HTML
3. CSS

## How to use the application

1. Firstly, create a student account through the Add Student button on the sidebar. Fill out the informaion and confirm it usin the button. This data will be stored in the local storage so if you refresh the browser it will still be avaialable.
2. Secondly, log in to your account using the log in inputs in the header, or by clicking on the log in image if on mobile or tablet. Now your student information will be updated to display the data of the student.
3. To add a referal to a student (they must already have information submitted for this to work), type in their name in the input found in the sidebar. Once submitted the data will be updated and will display when logged in to that account.
4. To send a message, open the modal through the sidebar. Then fill out the required inputs and then submit using the button found at the bottom. When logging into the account that recieves the message, it will be found inside the inboc container which can be opened through the sidebar.
5. When performing updates to a timetable, firstly open the container through the sidebar. This will reveal the update timetable button. Once you have inputted all the required information, press the update timetable button which will store the data once again inside the local storage. If you need to update the timetable, simply change the neccesary input and reconfirm it.
